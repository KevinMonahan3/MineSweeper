## MineSweeper

This is a minesweeper I created in my 1st year of college to help me get more familiar with creating a GUI in Java. It is coded soley in Java and uses JFrame for GUI controls.

## Project info

This project is a basic recreation of the game minesweeper. It contains the basic elements of minesweeper which is:
- Generating a GUI to display your playing area
- Placing mines randomly on the map
- Allowing you to place flags on designated tiles
- And clearing large empty spaces when clicked
